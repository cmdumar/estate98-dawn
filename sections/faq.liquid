        <p>Ultra Concentrated Coffee is crafted as an actual extraction, meaning that a batch of ground coffee is brewed similar to an espresso machine. Hot water is used to extract to a percentage and then stopped in order to keep all of the good compounds of the coffee. It is not a normal brew and dehydrated, as some concentrates are. From there, the coffee is bottled and pasteurized using thermal heat profiling. The only ingredients used in this process are coffee and water.

        <p>Ultra Concentrated Coffee is used as a concentrate  to be used as an ingredient in other beverages. Example: <br>
          Ultra Concentrated Coffee + hot water = coffee <br>
          Ultra Concentrated Coffee + water + ice = ice coffee <br>
          Ultra Concentrated Coffee + milk = latte <br>
          Our recommendation is to use 1 tbsp of Ultra <br>Concentrated Coffee for 6-8 oz liquid. <br> Adjust to taste. This can be used hot or iced.
